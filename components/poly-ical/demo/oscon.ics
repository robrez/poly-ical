SUMMARY:Building apps that run everywhere with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, a
 nd Apache Cordova
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Jonathan Stark (Jonathan Stark Consulting). It’
 s a fact: if you have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
 you already have the tools you need to develop your own web or hybrid ap
 ps for mobile. In this session, you’ll learn how to use these open sourc
 e web technologies to design and build apps for the iPhone, iPad, Androi
 d, etc. on the development platform of your choice—without using Objecti
 ve-C, Swift, or Java.

SUMMARY:Space, time, and state
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Amy Palamountain (GitHub). Reactive programming
  is the trendy new way to build desktop and mobile apps. Reacting to use
 r input over time can prove to be difficult, because of the enormous amo
 unt of state we need to keep track of. In this talk we will discover how
  to improve our reactive applications by removing the need for state ent
 irely. This allows us to clearly reason about, and react to, user input 
 over time.

SUMMARY:Java-based microservices, containers, Kubernetes - how to
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Ray Tsang (Google). Join this session to learn 
 how to create a Java-based microservice using Spring Boot, containerize 
 it using Maven plugins, and subsequently deploy a fleet of microservices
  and dependent components such as Redis using Kubernetes.  Toward the en
 d of the session, let's take a look at how we can apply the same pattern
 s to other runtimes, such as Vert.x and Grails.

SUMMARY:A rebasing workflow for Git
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Emma Jane Hogbin Westby (Git for Teams). You've
  decided to level up your Git skills and have heard that rebasing is whe
 re it's at. In this session we'll talk about: WHY rebasing can make it e

SUMMARY:Unicode beyond just characters: Localization with the CLDR
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Nick Patch (Shutterstock). Unicode is much more
  than just characters. The Unicode Consortium defines open standards for
  collating, parsing, and formatting data in much of the world’s language
 s. The Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) is the largest standard repo
 sitory of locale data along with specifications for its use, and is a po
 werful resource for software localization.

SUMMARY:Building a Python web application using Flask and Neo4j
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Nicole White (Neo4j). Flask, a popular Python w
 eb framework, has many tutorials available online which use an SQL datab
 ase to store information about the website’s users and their activities.
  In this tutorial, we will replace SQL with Neo4j, an open source graph 
 database, in order to build a simple microblog application with social f
 eatures that are otherwise too complex to model and express in SQL.

SUMMARY:Programming in Rust
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Jim Blandy (Mozilla Corporation). Learn to prog
 ram in Rust, a new systems programming language emphasizing safety and p
 erformance. Rust offers the same degree of control over performance as C

 are free of dangling pointers, leaks, null pointer dereferences and buff
 er overruns, making the language well-suited for security-sensitive and 
 multithreaded code.

SUMMARY:It's metaphors all the way down
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Brian Proffitt (Red Hat). Everything we do in t
 echnology - operating systems, applications, systems administration - is
  based on nothing solid and real, but rather conceptualizations and idea
 s that we make accessible through metaphors. In fact, far from being "no
 n-creative," nerd-types may be among the most creative storytellers in h
 istory.

SUMMARY:Say No like a boss!
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Deb Nicholson (Open Invention Network). There's
  always plenty to do in the world of free and open source software, but 
 saying yes to it all eventually leads to burnout. Not every job, module 
 or meeting is going to lead to more of the kinds of opportunities you wa
 nt. When should you reinvent the wheel and when should you settle for so
 mething that's good enough?

DESCRIPTION:Presented by Henrik Ingo (MongoDB). As open source has becom
 e mainstream and a business, many companies face a knowledge gap and may
  not even realize it: most executives and sales managers have no particu

 source folks have no experience in sales either! This session will help 
 each group to understand, and apply, both the open source and sales part
 s together.

SUMMARY:Nobody should know more about you than you do
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Alistair Croll (Solve For Interesting). In the 
 next decade, data-driven feeds will become the primary tool with which w

 d gardens, or profitable arbitrage—is fast becoming a moral issue. In th
 is session, Alistair Croll looks at the promises and perils of big data 
 as it finds its way into our lives, and makes far too many unreasonable 
 predictions along the way.

SUMMARY:How Facebook open sources at scale
DESCRIPTION:Presented by James Pearce (Facebook). Ship a lot, or ship fa
 st? These goals may seem to be at odds, but it's actually possible to ha

 t century is a time with an unprecendented expansion of ideas, culture,

  about it.

SUMMARY:They're here. Now what?
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Allison Randal (Hewlett-Packard). The early day
 s of the open source movement were all about creating an approachable on
 -ramp to software freedom. We focused strongly on practical benefits of 
 free software and refined the message, hoping to help the professional s
 oftware sector better understand. We succeeded but success in our first 
 goal doesn't mean we're done, it means we're due to clearly define the n
 ext phase of open source.

SUMMARY:Making things open
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Hadley Beeman (U.K. Government | W3C). Openness
  is good for Government on many levels — open data, open standards, open
  source, open markets. Where we set the way we work in Government, it’s 
 important to let industry determine the technical standards we work with
 .

SUMMARY:From analog to difital and back
DESCRIPTION:Presented by George Dyson. Nature uses digital coding for re
 plication, storage, and error correction, but relies on analog coding fo
 r control. Technology will follow. We are starting to treat streams of b
 its the way vacuum tubes treat streams of electrons, implementing analog
  processing upon a digital substrate, the same way digital processing wa
 s implemented using analog components, the first time around.
