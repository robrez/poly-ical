     <script src="ical.micro.js"></script>

     note:  micro was built using just these portions:
     [helpers, design, parse] from ical.js
     micro is only capable of parsing into json and cannot
     handle recurrence events.

     use min if you have trouble.

     ical.js not added as a dependency because it doesn't package
     a .min.js. Instead, I built them myself

     consider adding it to bower.conf  -- "ical.js": "~1.1.2
     <script src="bower_components/ical.js/lib/ical/helpers.js"></script>
     <script src="bower_components/ical.js/lib/ical/design.js"></script>
     <script src="bower_components/ical.js/lib/ical/parse.js"></script>
